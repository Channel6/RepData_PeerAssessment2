## Synopsis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities.

This report centers around the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

### The data analysis must address the following:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the ```EVTYPE``` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

### By aggregating the data by storm event type, this analysis shows:

* Tornados are the most harmfull events on population health (including injury and fatalities).
* Floods are responsible for the most economic damage.
